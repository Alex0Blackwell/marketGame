## Overview

This is a browser game I made in highschool that simulates the market. The game rewards quickly buying low and selling high. The game has a light item and a large item market in which you can buy from. Additionally, you also have your own market where you can sell what you have purchased from the light and heavy markets. The idea of the game is to make a profit!
